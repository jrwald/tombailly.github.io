			<h1>The missing manuals for your first set of tools!</h1>
			<p><!--<img src = "maleFemaleVitruvian.jpg" class = "bgpic"></img>-->Your body is the first "toolkit" you ever get... and it does NOT come with an instruction manual!  So you could bumble along like a fool full of enthusiasm running around in the dark until you run into something, possibly hurting yourself in the process.  Or let the study of Exercise Science and human motion give you the knowledge you need for a life of higher physical performance, mental acuity, and improved psychological well-being (just to name a few benefits).</p>
			
			<h2>How to Begin</h2>
			<p>We begin by marrying the qualitative to the quantitative.  You learn the correct language to use to describe things you've already been doing and saying.  Once you have a vocabulary in the language of Exercise Science that's universal, you can begin to investigate all the other variables.  The uninformed statement, "My arm hurts up top when I move it this way." will not open up the same level of thinking as "When I internally rotate my humerus and flex it past 90 degrees, there is a sharp pinching in the shoulder joint near the acromion."</p>

			<p><b>Main point - we can learn a lot by asking questions.</b>  The better our questions are, the more learning generally happens.  The better our vocabulary in a given discipline or study, the better our questions will tend to be.</p>

			<p><b>But this is EXERCISE Science!</b>  So go out and play with the knowledge learned from good questions and study.  Physically go out and test the difference between good and bad posture when you're walking and running.  Go to a park or soft-grounded place and make yourself fall to see how your kinesthetic sense begins to develop and appreciate all that your myofascia does for you.  Learn what good exercises are, what good form is, and how to translate those "gym exercises" into real-world function!</p>

			<h2>Drink the Kool-Aid - Study Exercise Science!!!</h2>
			<p><b>ACTION ALONE TURNS KNOWLEDGE INTO WISDOM.</b>  Given the myriad of benefits across all aspects of your life (physical, mental, and cognitive well-being), understanding the inner workings (the blood and guts, as it were) of the only body you'll ever get in this life just seems like the wisest course of action in the recipe for a better life.</p>
