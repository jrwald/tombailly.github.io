	<h1><a href="https://athleanx.com/">athleanx</a></h1>
	<p>The first good site I found was the Athleanx main page.  There is nice, stark contrast between the dark background and light text (and vice versa down lower on the main page) and according to the color picker in the developer tools, this page pretty much designs around 3 colors - black, white, and red.  It's clean and simple design of color forces you to pay more attention to the other design elements as well.  The semi-translucent video clips in the element in the background of the "Train like an athlete" marquee at the top is a really nice effect.  So too is the adapting, header that slims down, but remains fixed to the top of the browser window as you scroll down the page; this way you always have navigation wherever you're at on the page.  The header navigations are really nice dropdowns that have video and links to the parts of the site dealing with that particular navigation item.  There's another fixed widget on the bottom right of the browser window to ask the proprietor of the business a question... handy.  The three-bar dropdown at the top right of the page is a quick reference to all the links and info on the page and site.  The layout seems to be blocks stacked at first, then a transition to a series of inline columns or other container (looks like a div block that was given an inline character to display list items in a row) to show some of the products this site sells.  Each functional groupe of these column-like containers is visually seperated with an almost banner-like declaration of what's coming up.  This is a secure site with a SSL certificate and there is some social media interaction at the bottom of the page.
	</p>
	
	<p>The code is modern HTML5 with lots of scripts written in the code.  There are style elements as well as references to css files, and it uses Google Analytics.  You can see in the code where some of the graphic objects are actually coded in instead of just img elements.  I don't pretend to understand all the scripting and other code, but there's a lot of intelligent code behind this main site.  I see try-catch blocks to deal with errors that could arise.  There are hover dynamics for mousing over certain elements, and lots of use of divs, classes and id's.  The code is pretty easy to read and well-laid out in terms of putting like, functional blocks of code together and good use of indenting to make reading it easier.  It also dynamically resizes the page elements as the screen gets smaller.  This code, along with the other good one above makes extensive use of list items and unordered lists.
	</p>
	
	<p>I'm not just a spokesman, I'm a member!  Inside the navigation across workouts and nutrition plans is pretty easy.  There is an exercise library that has both text descriptions and video clips of how to properly perform the movements.  There is a visual layout of a calendar that lays out different events to work towards and a nutrition journal.  There's also a forum so members can talk to each other and the owner about different topics.

	<h1><a href="https://www.sololearn.com/">sololearn</a></h1>
	<p>The second good site I found was the sololearn main page.  Sololearn is a site that teaches different programming languages via prepared lesson plans in a sequential order for each language.  The image in the header is appropriate to the content of the page.  All the link buttons have code that makes them darker when the mouse hovers over them and they are nicely rounded on the corners.  The whole site dynamically resizes as the browser window changes in size.  None of the navigations are fixed, so you lose them as you scroll down, but the organization of data is good and there are duplicate links for some of the navigations from the top as well as basic contact info at the bottom too.  The rows of the buttons for the apps stores and the classes offered are kept current to the most commonly used apps stores and the more in-demand language courses.  There are social media links at the bottom of the page also.
	</p>
	
	<p>The code does a lot of work with svg and g elements for some of the button graphics in the navigation links at the top.  The apps store links are all in div elements, which are block, but they're also associated with a class of their own, so I'm guessing somewhere in the stylesheet, they're told to behave like inline-block or some other similar inline element.  Span elements are used within the div blocks to make a row-like alignment arrangement when needed.  A similar approach was used for the row of course buttons.  This is really simple coding in terms of overall layout, and I think that makes it really stable code.  I see the use of the break element to make multi-line text blocks.  This code, along with the other good one above uses of list items and unordered lists; it also uses Google Analytics.

	<h1><a href="http://www.arngren.net/">arngren</a></h1>
	<p>The poor site I found was the arngren main page.  I think this may be the European version of Harbor Freight, except worse...  I didn't realize it at first, but there's a pretty "adult" section right smack in the middle of all this weird, family crap.  Maybe I have old eyes, and I am colorblind as a dog, but there's so much crammed and packed into this main page it has to have a horizontal scroll-bar - <b>eww</b>.  The website's code is a pretty gigantic cluster of really jumbled tables with no cell spacing (which is probably why there's overlap of words and images).  It uses a lot of style elements in the HTML itself, which we've come to learn isn't especially the best practice, usually.  There is a lot of use of divs and spans, but nothing spectacular in the more articulate use of HTML5 elements.  It's really hard to navigate around this page, and the links to "contacts" and other pertinent information are not visually seperated in any way; they're actually hard to find at first. 
	</p>

	<p>The links link to more tables!  That scroll horizontally off the page!!!  The layout leaves much to be desired and is just visually irritating.  The oddly-shaped borders around different items for sale are annoying and don't really add any function in terms of data organization for display.  This website is NOT secured with a SSL certificate.
	</p>
	
	<p>This site has crappy navigation, horrible layout and image scaling, inappropriate content in the main page, and many other things going against it.  On Tom's scale from One to Awesome, this site gets a "Weak Sauce!"
